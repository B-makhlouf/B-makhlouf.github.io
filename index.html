							<p> Understanding the spatial ecology of mobile species presents challenges to researchers
								and resource managers.
								Many of these species travel of vast distances and through rugged landscapes , making
								manual monitoring difficult or impossible
								in many cases. This is particularily the case in aquatic species, in which the added
								barrier of the underwater environment
								makes monitoring exceedingly difficult. However, many migratory species provide
								important ecosystem, economic, and cultural services which are under threat from
								environmental change and human resource use. As such, there is a pressing need to
								develop and deploy methods which can elucidate patterns of habitat use, migration, and
								provenance in an effort to design effective management and conservation strategies in a
								novel future.

							<p> I aim to harness the sequential uptake of chemical and isotopic signatures of ear stones
								of fishes, and otoliths, to reconstruct spatial patterns at an ecosystem scale.
								Most of my work centers around understanding these patterns in Pacific salmon species in
								western Alaska watersheds, where they support a multi million dollar commercial industry
								as well as subsistance opportunities across the region.
								I use a combination of laboratory experiments, field work, and statistical analysis
								techniques to develop improvements to existing models
								and apply them to pressing fisheries research questions in Alaska and beyond.
								Doing so contributes to a growing toolset of research tools which can be used to address
								increasingly complex and
								urgent questions in the field of spatial ecology.

					<h2>Improving methods for reconstructing provenance</h2>
					<p></p>
				</header>
				<p> I'm working to improve current otolith-based methods for reconstructing provenance and migration in
					three ways. Firstly, I am exploring the use of multiple concurrant
					data sources to improve the precision of basin scale reconstructions and expand their use to new
					study systems. Secondly, I am using laboratory experiments
					to confront assumptions of current models about otolith element incorporation and turnover rates.
					These include testing the effects of diet subsidies on
					otolith chemistry, as well as the influence of changing water chemistry and variable growth rates.
					Finally, I am working to apply
					emerging statistical and data science methods to existing data sets, which may allow us to find
					additional structure in our existing data and use them to
					explore new research questions.

					<h2>Addressing pressing fisheries research questions </h2>

				</header>
				<p> As the power of otolith based methods continues to increase, I am working to apply these methods to
					answer
					questions of management concern in fisheries research. In western Alaska, the catastrophic run
					collapse of Chinook and Chum salmon
					has motivated a large scale research effort to understand the drivers of these declines and
					ecosystem processes which may help build resilliancy
					in these populations. I am working to apply otolith-based methods to understand the spatial ecology
					within coastal alaska watersheds and to
					better understand the spatial distribution of stressors such as bycatch on these populations. In
					doing so, I hope to contribute towards the
					large scale effort to understand and manage these populations in the face of a changing climate and
					increasing human pressures.
